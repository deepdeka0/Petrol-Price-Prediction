# Petrol-Price-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of forecasting future petrol prices. By analyzing historical data on petrol prices, crude oil prices, relevant economic indicators, and other relevant factors, the model aims to identify patterns and trends to predict price fluctuations. The project utilizes Python with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and potentially Prophet or other time series forecasting libraries. The model will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Â
